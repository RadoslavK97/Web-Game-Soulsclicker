# Web-Game-Soulsclicker
A small and unfinished HTML browser game - Soulsclicker. Inspired by Cookie Clicker, the goal is to click the bonfire, gather souls and use them to buy upgrades for faster soul generation

# 1. How to run?
Start the index.html file and you are all set.

# 2. How to play?
Click on the bonfire and gather souls. With souls you can purchase upgrades that increment your souls per second, giving you more souls for more upgrades

# 3. Technology
I have used standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to implement the logic of the souls counter and the upgrades. I also used asynchronous functions like SetInterval in order to make the logic for the souls to update each second based on the upgrades we have available.

# 4. Currently work in progress with no definite end date
